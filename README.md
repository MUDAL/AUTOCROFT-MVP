# AUTOCROFT-POC-2

Improved Master-Node Architecture for Autocroft (IoTeam's custom and unique automated irrigation system).  
This version (or prototype) is based on one master and several base nodes.  

# CHANGES TO MAKE  
1.) HC12 to use non-blocking polling for DMA  
2.) HC12 software timer code should be deprecated since message size is known and fixed.
