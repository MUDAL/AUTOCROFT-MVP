# AUTOCROFT-MVP

Autocroft is an IoT-based automatic irrigation system designed and developed by **IoTeam**.

This codebase is an improved Master-Node Architecture based on one master and several base nodes.  
The base nodes collect data and forward them to the master.  
The master processes data from multiple base nodes and sends to the cloud.    

# Current version  
Version 1.0

# Design Plans / Improvements for next version (Version 1.1) 
1. MOSFET driver using LM358N: The MOSFET will be used to power external hardware down in order to improve power consumption.  
2. Replace voltage regulators with buck converters where necessary.
